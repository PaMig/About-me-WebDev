                    Hello,<br>My name is Paris Ioannis Migklis and toghether we are going to learn how about web development.<br>
                    The three main coding languages you will have to learn in order to get started with web development are: HTML, CSS, Javascript.<br>
                    HTML is used for the structural part of the website,as the content of the website the headers  and other information you will<br>
                    have to put on your website.Now after we have created a website with html what we will need is to add some style to it,<br>
                    and thatâ€™s where css comes in.Css is a very fun coding language which helps you add color,<br>
                    images and other fun features to your page.Last but not least you will have to add a javascript to your website in order <br>
                    to control your functions and put them to actions.Such actions can be the pressing of a button or even a simple hover to <br>
                    initiate a change to your website.<br>
